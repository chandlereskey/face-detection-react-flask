I think to run all you need to do is run npm run dev in the react app folder, then install dependencies and run the main.py file. 
I need to take the time to make the requirements.txt but I used pycharm to create the project and just have the interpretter settings set up there

this is basically a react app and flask server built on top of the logic from this repo I did a while ago which was based on a youtube video I found:
